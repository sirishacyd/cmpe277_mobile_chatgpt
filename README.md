### Android ChatGPT APP

To use this endpoint in your Android app, you need to make an API call to the URL provided by the Django app. You can use OkHttp to make the API call in your Android app. To ensure that the Django app allows requests from the Android emulator, you need to add the emulator's IP address to the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in your Django app's settings.py file. You can find the emulator's IP address by running adb shell ifconfig in your terminal.
